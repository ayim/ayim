## Hey, I'm Aaron 👋

Currently located in NYC, I'm most excited about translating frontier research into experiences users love.

* At Microsoft, I shipped **IntelliCode** — the first commercial AI code completion tool and invented the **grey-text inline suggestion UX** that's now the industry standard in every AI coding tool (Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, you name it).
* I also shipped **GitHub Copilot** in Visual Studio, leading Edits Mode, Agent Mode, and planning/code-mapping features.

Now I'm a **Senior PM at [Sema4.ai](https://sema4.ai)**, building an finance agent platform for Fortune 500 companies.

### What I'm working on

- 🤖 Enterprise AI agents on **Firecracker microVMs** where the code interpreter and files are first class primitives.
- 🧠 **Skill-level RL** — using reinforcement learning to improve agent skills (classifiers, extractors, tool use) and their selection based on production outcomes
- 📊 Evaluation frameworks that don't just evaluate accuracy (pass@k) but rather consistency (pass^k) to help us get towards deterministic execution.

### Publications & Patents

- 📄 **Senior author:** [Towards More Effective AI-Assisted Programming](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172834/) — ICSE-SEIP 2023, IEEE/ACM. The paper behind the grey-text UX and inline code change interfaces now used by millions.
- 🔐 **2 patents** on AI-assisted coding — [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZQdvRdoAAAAJ&hl=en)
