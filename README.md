## Hey, I'm Aaron 👋

Currently located in NYC, I'm most excited about translating frontier research into experiences users love.

- At Microsoft, I shipped **IntelliCode**, the first AI autocomplete from 0 → 3M+ users; along the way, shipping the **grey-text / inline diff UX** now used by Cursor and Antigravity.
- I later worked on **GitHub Copilot** in Visual Studio — leading Edits Mode, Agent Mode, and planning features.
- Now I'm a **Senior PM at [Sema4.ai](https://sema4.ai)**, building an finance agent platform for Fortune 500 companies.

### What I'm working on

- **AI Agents for finance** where code interpreters, documents, and files are first-class primitives.
- **Skill-level RL** — Improve agent skills (classifiers, extractors, tool use) and their selection based on production outcomes.
- **Evaluation frameworks** for consistency (pass^k), not just accuracy (pass@k) — getting us toward deterministic execution.
